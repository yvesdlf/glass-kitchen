## Chef Notes

- Do not prepare avocado mash too far in advance; make as close to service as possible to prevent browning.  
- Lime juice helps prevent oxidation; brush lightly over exposed avocado if needed.  
- The contrast of warm, crispy toast with cool, creamy guacamole is essential to the dish.  
- Maldon salt's flaky texture adds a premium finishing touch.
